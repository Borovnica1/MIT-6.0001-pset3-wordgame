# MIT-6.0001-pset3-wordgame

Let's begin by describing the word game: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With
Friends. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their
letters. Each ​ valid ​ word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the
letters in that word.
